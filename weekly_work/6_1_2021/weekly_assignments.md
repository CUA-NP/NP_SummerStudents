1. Windows users: install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). macOS users: use macOS Terminal or install install VirtualBox + Ubuntu Linux.
2. Run Command prompt. Discover root filesystem folders that were not mentioned in current lecture.
3. Compose your TODO list. Create three files each containing one line of text (TODO item). For instance, `item1.txt`, `item2.txt`, `item3.txt`. Expert: try using a unique approaches to create every `item?.txt` on the file system. Look up how to create a file with `touch`, `nano` and `echo`. Extra creative: instead of the TODO list try composing a three-line Haiku.
4. Use Command Line Control Flow to join above three files into a single file on your computer, e.g. `todo.txt`. Expert: install `cowsay` and pipe the concatenated file to the `cowsay -n`.
5. Privacy is the key! Modify your `todo.txt` permissions. Restrict read, write and execute for other users on the system.
6. Do some research online and find some linux terminal script or program that you think is cool (try looking on Reddit, Google, YouTube, etc). Maybe on the next lesson we will try installing some of the terminal programs you found and will give them a try.
