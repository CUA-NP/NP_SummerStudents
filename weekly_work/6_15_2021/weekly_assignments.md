## Nilanga
1. Install ROOT on your computer using a binary distribution or source.
2. Produce a histogram randomly filled with 50000 entries with a Gaussian function of mean = 1.0 GeV and sigma = 50 MeV and 1000 bins from 0.5-1.5 GeV.
3. Label the axes assuming you’re plotting a mass spectrum of a resonance.
4. Try two coarser binning options for histogram from the editor and
compare the fit results (use the Gaussian for the fit).
5. Obtain the integral of the histogram for (mean +- 2 sigma) mass range.

### Geant4 practice
* Check out the [GEANT4 YouTube Mini Course by Jing Liu](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw3G-vTgPrdBtrdWML8j7dYhylZDSgU1j). Tutorial covers installation of GEANT4 on your local computer and basic framework use.
* Login to the Computing Farm environment.
    * Copy Geant4 examples to your home folder.
    * Pick a GEANT4 example from `basic` folder.
    * Get familiar with the example’s README file. 
    * Compile and run example.
    * Familiarize yourself with Geant4 interactive GUI. Shoot a few events. Rotate and move camera etc...

### ROOT practice
Check out this [5-day ROOT tutorial](https://www.lpc-caen.in2p3.fr/root/Formation/en/). In addition to Nilanga’s introduction to the ROOT scripting language this tutorial also covers the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of ROOT.

You do not have to go through all five days. Things can get a little challenging along the way.
