# Nuclear Physics Summer Research at CUA

## 2020 Projects
* **Global fitting of pion and kaon data (Mina, Leslie)** - use a suitable software to fit the data with a suitable fit form. Report the fit and the goodness of the fit. You may need to do some online research on fitting techniques and uncertainty reporting.
    * [unsep_kaon](weekly_work/7_6_2020/pion_kaon_data/unsep_kaon.dat)
    * [unsep_pion](weekly_work/7_6_2020/pion_kaon_data/unsep_pion.dat)
    * Please also include the new kaon data from the file [PhysRevC97](references/sep_kaon_sig_FF_6_GeV.pdf)

* **Mechanical performance of aerogel material (Sahnnee)** - find a suitable mechanical software to open and modify the attached files. There are many possible options! The goal will be to have models of aerogel tiles with different configurations of fiber glass mesh and to analyze their mechanical performance.
    * [Aerogel_10cm_X_10cm_X_1cm](weekly_work/7_6_2020/aerogel_data/Aerogel_10cm_X_10cm_X_1cm.stp) - aerogel tile with no modification
    * [Aerogel_10cm_X_10cm_X_1cm_01](weekly_work/7_6_2020/aerogel_data/Aerogel_10cm_X_10cm_X_1cm_01.stp) - aerogel tile with cutout for fiberglass
    * [Fiber_glass_mesh](weekly_work/7_6_2020/aerogel_data/Fiber_glass_mesh.stp)
